## YAMP: a framework enabling reproducibility in metagenomics research

This talk has been given as an invited talk at the Computational Biology Seminars, Francis Crick Institute, London, December 2017.

A similar talk with a much stronger focus on Research Reproducibility and Open Science, entitled *My reproducible adventure in (meta)genomics (A tale of workflow development, reasearch reproducibility & open science)*, was given at the [researc/hers code](https://twitter.com/ResearcHersCode) Seminars, London, December 2017. 

I share here only one slide deck, which includes material from both events.
