Simplifying shotgun metagenomics analysis with Nextflow

Thanks to the increased cost-effectiveness of high-throughput technologies, the amount of data collected on microorganisms (bacteria, archaea, microbial eukaryotes, fungi, and viruses) has surged, boosting the development of software for their analysis. Nevertheless, researchers may not have the necessary expertise to define and implement data processing workflows nor to install and run software on their local machine or cluster. By using the Nextflow framework, we developed a novel metagenomics analysis workflow, YAMP, that is simple to use, easily portable, and very flexible and customisable. Moreover, the integration with a Docker container saves the users from the hassle of installing the required software, increasing, at the same time, the reproducibility of the results.
